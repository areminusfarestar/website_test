Dr. Matthew Huber is an expert in climate change and extreme weather, past climates, large-scale ecosystem change, and climate-driven heat stress including its impacts on humans and agriculture. He is a professor in the Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences Department at Purdue University and was the founder of and inaugural Director of the Institute for a Sustainable Future (ISF), transdisciplinary institute working on both fundamental and applied research in areas.  

Huber's internationally recognized scholarship explores Earth's habitability, resilience, and sustainability, delving into tropical temperatures regulation, polar amplification of warming, and their global implications. His work emphasizes a systems-based approach, integrating climate modeling with energy, environment, economics, health, politics, and society. His current work focuses on building systems resilience and preventing systemic collapse. 

With over 160 peer-reviewed articles, Huber's work has garnered recognition and media coverage, positioning him as leader in climate science and resilience.  Huber was elected a Fellow of the American Academy for the Advancement of Science in 2025 and was awarded the American Geophysical Union Ascent Award in 2018. He is currently Editor-in-Chief of the AGU journal Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology. His work has been featured in the Reuters, CNN, New York Times, Washington Post, Discover Magazine, New Scientist, USA Today, Bloomberg.
